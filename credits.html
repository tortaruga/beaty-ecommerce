        <h1>Credits & Disclaimer</h1>
        <p>
            The present website is a coding project and as such everything it contains is fake. We don't sell anything. We wouldn't know where to start, honestly. We own nothing to sell. Signing up to the newsletter will do absolutely nothing, since that email is stored nowhere and I have no way of ever seeing it: that would require some backend coding, and this project is strictly frontend.
        </p>

        <p>
            All the images used are free license pictures from pexels. They are used purely as example, and any brand that may be present has nothing to do with me or this website. The prices are made-up and random, so they may not reflect the actual prices of the brands. If you have any issue with your brand being featured in this project contact me and I'll remove the pictures containing it. 
        </p>

            Don't sue me because that would be a waste of money and time. You surely have more money than me, so as far as money goes it would be only a waste for myself I guess, but what about time? Do you have more time than the rest of us mortals? Doesn't the black wolf chase you too, as it does all of us? Do you believe it would stop for you, and let you catch your breath and smell the roses? The roses are already rotting. You are already fading. Keep running. He's coming.

            All the icons are from <a href="https://icons8.it/icons" target="_blank">icons8</a>. The idea of the card design with the rounded inverted borders came from <a href="https://codepen.io/svebal/pen/ExzKwpY" target="_blank">this cool pen here</a> by <a href="https://codepen.io/svebal" target="_blank">sven balzer</a>. The product images and the hero are from <a href="https://www.pexels.com/it-it/" target="_blank">pexels</a>.
