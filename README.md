# Overview

[live site url](https://tortaruga.github.io/beauty-ecommerce/)

This is an e-commerce website for a fictitious beauty brand. The project was meant as practice for  building multi-page websites. 

# Features to add

- the newsletter section is missing feedback when the email is valid to let the user know they are now successfully signed up;

- there should be the option to remove the items from the cart (right now the only way to do so is to select 0 as item quantity);

- the cart icon on the nav only displays the number of items from the product page. the icon on the nav bar of any other page doesn't work;

# notes for self and autoevaluation

could i have done a better job organizing the five hundred thirty seven thousand files that this project consists of? yes. yes i could have. 
it's my first time building something with multiple pages so i thought about it when it was too late to change all the file paths. i apologize to the gods of basic decency. but next time you won't catch me slipping.
